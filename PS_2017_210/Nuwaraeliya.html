        <h3>Nuwara Eliya</h3>
        <p>
          The town's attractions include the golf course, trout streams,
          Victoria Park, and boating or fishing on Lake Gregory. Victoria Park
          is an attractive and well-used oasis. It is popular with birdwatchers
          at quieter times because of the good opportunities for seeing species,
          particularly the Indian blue robin, pied thrush or scaly thrush
          lurking in the denser undergrowth. The Kashmir flycatcher is another
          attractive bird species in the park. Galway's Land Bird Sanctuary,
          close to Lake Gregory, is an area of montane forest a few kilometers
          east of the town. Covering an area of 0.6 km2 it is home to many bird
          and mammal species endemic to Sri Lanka, including wild boar and
          barking deer. The city is a base for visits to Horton Plains National
          Park. This is a key wildlife area of an open grassy woodland. Species
          found here include the leopard, sambar, and the endemic purple-faced
          langur. Endemic highland birds include the dull-blue flycatcher, Sri
          Lanka white-eye, and yellow-eared bulbul. The plains have a
          well-visited tourist attraction at World's End â€” a sheer precipice
          with a 1050 m drop. The return walk passes the scenic Baker's Falls.
          Early morning visits are best, both to see the wildlife and to view
          World's End before mists close in during the later part of the
          morning. One of the distinctive features of Nuwara Eliya's countryside
          is the widespread growing of vegetables, fruit and flowers usually
          associated with temperate Europe. This "Little England" is covered
          with terraces growing potatoes, carrots, leeks, and roses interspersed
          with tea bushes on the steeper slopes. The slow-growing tea bushes of
          this highland region produce some of the world's finest orange pekoe
          tea. Several tea factories around Nuwara Eliya offer guided tours and
          the opportunity to sample or purchase their products. 'Lovers Leap' is
          a spectacular waterfall set among tea plantations a short walk from
          the town of Nuwara Eliya. It falls a height of 30m in a long cascading
          sheet of water. It is said that it is named after a young couple who
          decided to be bound together forever by jumping off the cliff to their
          demise.
