        <h3>Sigiriya</h3>
        <p>
          Sigiriya is one of the most valuable historical monuments of Sri
          Lanka. Referred by locals as the Eighth Wonder of the World this
          ancient palace and fortress complex has significant archaeological
          importance and attracts thousands of tourists every year. It is
          probably the most visited tourist destination of Sri Lanka. The palace
          is located in the heart of the island between the towns of Dambulla
          and Habarane on a massive rocky plateau 370 meters above the sea
          level. Sigiriya rock plateau, formed from magma of an extinct volcano,
          is 200 meters higher than the surrounding jungles. Its view astonishes
          the visitors with the unique harmony between the nature and human
          imagination. The fortress complex includes remnants of a ruined
          palace, surrounded by an extensive network of fortifications, vast
          gardens, ponds, canals, alleys and fountains. The main entrance is
          located in the northern side of the rock. It was designed in the form
          of a huge stone lion, whose feet have survived up to today but the
          upper parts of the body were destroyed. Thanks to this lion the palace
          was named Sigiriya. The term Sigiriya originates from the word
          Sihagri, i.e. Lion Rock. The western wall of Sigiriya was almost
          entirely covered by frescoes, created during the reign of Kasyapa.
          Eighteen frescoes have survived to this day. The frescoes are
          depicting nude females and are considered to be either the portraits
          of Kasyapaâ€™s wives and concubines or priestess performing religious
          rituals. Despite the unknown identity of the females depicted in the
          frescoes, these unique ancient paintings are celebrating female beauty
          and have incredible historical significance. One of the most striking
          features of Sigiriya is its Mirror wall. In the old days it was
          polished so thoroughly that the king could see his reflection in it.
          The Mirror wall is painted with inscriptions and poems written by the
          visitors of Sigiriya.
