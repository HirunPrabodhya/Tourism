					<h1>Cultural Life</h1>
					<p>
					   Sri Lanka is a land of great cultural diversity. Religion pervades many aspects of life and constitutes a basic element of this diversity. 
					   Buddhist and Hindu temples, as well as mosques and churches, with their own colourful rituals, are the most readily visible features of 
					   the cultural landscape.In architecture, sculpture, and painting, Sri Lanka’s traditions extend far back into antiquity. The remnants of
					   ancient works restored and preserved at archaeological sites, while reflecting Indian influences, also bear testimony to the inspiration 
					   derived from Buddhism.

					<!--History of SriLanka block-->
					<h1>History of SriLanka</h1>
					<p>
						Sri Lanka has had a continuous record of human settlement for more than two millennia, and its civilization has been shaped largely by that 
						of the Indian subcontinent. The island’s two major ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the Tamils, and its two dominant religions, Buddhism and 
						Hinduism, made their way to the island from India, and Indian influence pervaded such diverse fields as art, architecture, literature, music, 
						medicine, and astronomy.

					<h1>Festival of SriLanka</h1>

						The Kandy Esala Perahera is a week-long festival which is considered one of the oldest and most extravagant of Sri Lanka’s Buddhist celebrations. 
						This grand holiday observed in the month of Esala (July or August), is also known as the Festival of the Tooth and pays homage to the sacred tooth 
						relic of the Buddha, which is enshrined in the city’s revered temple. During this period, thousands of Sri Lankan’s flock to the central city of Kandy 
						to watch and take part in the extravaganza. Throughout the festival, some 5,000 dancers, drummers, fire jugglers, musicians perform during various celebrations 
						and processions who are all lavishly dressed wearing elaborate traditional costumes. Even elephants take part in the parade and are adorned with flamboyant garments
						and gems.With spectacular goings-on every day during the festival, the experience is unmissable if you are in Sri Lanka during this time.</br></br>

					<h1>SriLankan Life in the Home</h1>
					<p>
						Life revolves around the family for most Sri Lankans. In collectivist cultures such as that of Sri Lanka, the family is the first group a person becomes 
						a member of at birth. The interests of the family are expected to come before those of the individual and loyalty (such as preferential treatment) is 
						shown to fellow family members. Furthermore, the acts of an individual can impact the perception of the entire family by others.A person’s most important 
						relationships are usually within the nuclear family, but connections with one’s extended family are also deeply valued. Three or four generations often live 
						together, with the male side of the family connecting the relations. While the mother holds a significant amount of household authority and is respected, 
						the father (or eldest son) is usually the patriarch. Age is also a source of hierarchy within the household, with elders being highly respected and cared 
						for at home by the family far into their old age. As a token of respect, it is customary to address any elders as “aunty” or “uncle”.
							</br></br>
						Arranged marriages were once common in Sri Lanka and may continue in rural parts of Sri Lanka. Marriages are arranged to pair people of the same socioeconomic status,
						ethnicity and caste (if relevant) to ensure the social order and structure of society. Linking to the idea of purity underpinning the caste system, the sexual ‘purity’ 
						of the woman also plays an essential part in the marriage contract. However, arranged marriages are no longer common practice among the younger generation. There is a rise 
						in ‘love marriages’, which are initiated by the couples themselves. The newlyweds are often of the same socioeconomic status and ethnicity, yet the man is expected to be 
						slightly more qualified, educated and older than the female.
